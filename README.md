Introduction:
- The purpose of this website is to centralize study resources and upload my coding exercises for students to access both at school and at home. The website is live at passwithalwin.ca.

Features:
- The website summarizes the mission of the Peer-Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) program and includes links to the official Mohawk College PASS website for further information.
- The ‘About Me’ page included a brief introduction and highlights of my hobbies and interests to help students get to know me as their PASS leader.
- The ‘Resources’ page included direct links to materials frequently accessed and used during my sessions.
- The ‘Sessions’ page featured coding exercises designed to reinforce the lessons taught by the professor each week and to help students deepen their understanding of the concepts covered.
- The site also includes a link to contact me directly via email.

Project Status:
- The design and development of the website is completed. The ‘Sessions’ page will be updated to include new coding exercises for the students each week. 

Used Technologies:
- This project was built using Visual Studio Code version 1.98.0 and developed with HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3.3.

Libraries:
- Bootstrap 5.3.3 – Implemented to create a structured layout and ensure responsive design across devices.

Sources:
- The idea behind this project was mainly to help me organize my role as a PASS leader and provide resources to help students excel in the course. Bootstrap played a key role in assisting with the overall layout and responsive design; however, it was also a great opportunity to learn how to host a website online
